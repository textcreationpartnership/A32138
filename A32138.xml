            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THe knowledge I had of the deſires of my Scottiſh Subjects, was the cauſe of my calling the laſt Aſſembly of Parliament, wherein had I been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved; I ſincerely think, that things had not faln out as now we ſee. But it is no wonder that men are ſo ſlow to beleeve that ſo great a ſedition ſhould be raiſed on ſo little ground. But now my Lords, and Gentlemen, the honour and ſafety of this Kingdom lying ſo nearly at the ſtake; I am reſolved to put my ſelf freely, and cleerly on the love and affections of my Engliſh Subjects, as theſe of my Lords that did wait on me at <hi>York,</hi> very well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I there declared. Therefore my Lords, I ſhall not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mine own intereſt, or that ſupport I might juſtly expect from you, till the common ſafety be ſecured; though I muſt tell you I am not aſhamed to ſay, thoſe charges I have been at, have been meerly for the ſecuring and good of this Kingdom, though the ſucceſſe hath not been anſwerable to my deſires. Therefore I ſhall onely deſire you to conſider the beſt way both for the ſafety and ſecurity of this Kingdom, wherein their are two parts chiefly conſiderable. Firſt, the chaſtiſing out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels. And ſecondly, the other, in ſatisfying your juſt grievances, wherein I ſhall promiſe you to concurre ſo heartily and clearly with you, that all the World may
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103839:3"/>ſee my intentions have ever been, and ſhall be, to make this a glorions and flouriſhing Kingdom. There are onely two things that I ſhall mention to you; Firſt, the one is to tell you that the Loan of money which I lately had from the City of <hi>London,</hi> wherein the Lords that waited on me at <hi>York</hi> aſſiſted me, will onely maintain my Army for two moneths from the beginning of that time it was granted. Now my Lords, and Gentlemen, I leave it to your conſiderations, what diſhonour and miſchief it might be, in caſe for want of money my Army be disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before the Rebels be put out of this Kingdom. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the ſecuring the calamities the Northern people endure at this time, and ſo long as the treaty is on foot. And in this I may ſay not onely they, but all this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome will ſuffer the harm; therefore I leave this alſo to your conſideration, for the ordering of theſe great affairs whereof you are to treat at this time. I am ſo confident of your love to me, and that your care is for the honour and ſafety of the Kingdom, that I ſhall freely and willingly leave to you where to begin: onely this, that you may the better know the ſtate of all the Affairs. I have commanded my Lord Keeper to give you a ſhort and free accompt of theſe things that have hapned in this interim, with this Proteſtation, that if this accompt be not ſatisfactory as it ought to be. I ſhall whenſoever you deſire, give you a full and perfect accompt of every particular. One thing more I deſire of you, as one of the greateſt means to make this a happy Parliament; That you on your parts, as I on Mine, lay aſide all ſuſpition one of another, as I promiſed my Lords at <hi>York;</hi> It ſhall not be my fault if this be not a happy and good Parliament.</p>

            <p>I do expect that you will haſtily make relation to the Houſe of Commons, of thoſe great affairs, for which I have called you hither at this time, and for the truſt I have repoſed in them, and how freely I put my ſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n their love and affections at that time; and that you may know the better how to do ſo, I ſhall explain my ſelf concerning one thing I ſpake the laſt day. I told you the Rebells muſt be put out of this Kingdom; its true, I muſt needs call them ſo, ſo long as they have an Army that do invade us; and although I am under treaty with them, and I under my great Seal do call them Subjects, and ſo they are too, but the ſtate of my Affairs in ſhort is this. Its true, I did expect when I did will my Lords and great ones at <hi>York,</hi> to have given a gracious anſwer to all your grievances; for I was in good hope by their wiſedomes and aſſiſtances to have made an end of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, but I muſt tell you that my Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> did ſo delay them, that it was not poſſible to end there: Therefore I can no wayes blame my Lords that were at <hi>Rippon,</hi> that the treaty was not ended, but muſt thank them for their pains and induſtry, and certainly had they as much power as affections, I ſhould by that time have brought theſe diſtempers to a happy period; ſo that now the treaty is tranſported from <hi>Rippon</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> where I ſhall conclude nothing without your knowledge, and I doubt not but by your approbation; for I do not deſire to have this great work done in a corner, for I ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <salute>My Lords,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe Knights, Citizens, Burgeſſes; The principall cauſe of my coming here at this time, is by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the flow proceedings in Parliament, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which is a great deal of inconvenience.</p>
            <p>Therefore I think it very neceſſary to lay before you the ſtate of my affairs as now they ſtand, thereby to haſten (not interrupt) your proceedings.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I muſt remember you that there are two Armies, in the Kingdom, in a manner maintained by you, the very naming of which, doth more cleerly ſhew the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience thereof, then a better tongue then mine can expreſſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the firſt place, I ſhall recommend unto you the quick diſpatch of that buſineſſe, aſſuring you that it cannot reſt upon me.</p>
            <p>In the next place I muſt recommend unto you the State of my Navy and Forts; the condition of both which is ſo well known unto you, that I need not tell you the particulars, onely thus much; they are the Walls and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of this Kingdom, which if out of order, all men may eaſily judge what incouragement it will be to Our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103839:4"/>enemies, and what diſhearing to our friends.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, (and not of the leaſt to be conſidered) I muſt lay before you the diſtractions that are at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſioned through the cauſe of Parliament; for there are ſome men that more maliciouſly then ignorantly, will put no difference between Reformation, and alteration of government.</p>
            <p>Hence it cometh that divine Service is irreverently interrupted, and Petitions in an ill way given in, neither diſputed nor denied. But I will enter into no more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, but ſhew you a way of remedy, by ſhewing you my cleer intentions, and ſome mark that may hinder this good work.</p>
            <p>I ſhall willingly and cheerfully concur with you for the Reformation of all Innovations both in Church, and Common-wealth, and conſequently that all Courts of Juſtice may be reformed according to Law. For my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions is cleerly to reduce all things to the beſt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt times as they were in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, whatſoever part of my Revenew ſhall be found illegall or heavy to my Subjects, I ſhall be willing to lay down, truſting in their affections. Having thus cleerly and ſhortly ſet down my intentions, I will ſhew you ſome rubs, and muſt needs take notice of ſome very ſtrange (I know not what tearm to give them) Petitions given in the name of divers Counties, againſt the eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed government of the Church, and of the great threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt the Biſhops, that they will make them to be but a Cipher, or at leaſt taken away.</p>
            <p>If ſome of them have incroached too much upon the Temporalty (if it be ſo) I ſhall not be unwilling theſe things ſhould be redreſſed and reformed, as all other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes according to the wiſdome of former times; ſo farre I ſhall go with you, no farther.</p>
            <p>If upon ſerious debate you ſhall ſhew that Biſhops have ſome Temporall Authority, not ſo neceſſary for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103839:5"/>of the Church, and upholding Epiſcopall Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction; I ſhall not be unwilling to deſire them to lay it down, but this muſt not be underſtood, that I ſhall any way conſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t that their voyce in Parliament ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; for in all the times of my Predeceſſors ſince the Conqueſt; and before, they have enjoyed it; I am bound to maintain them in it, as one of the fundamentall Inſtitutions of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>There is one other Rock you are on, not in ſubſtance, but in ſervice; and the form is ſo eſſentiall, that unleſſe it be reformed, will ſplit you on that R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There is a Bill lately put in concerning Parliaments. The thing I like well to have frequent Parliaments, but for Sheriffes and Conſtables to uſe my Authority, I can no wayes conſent unto.</p>
            <p>But to ſhew that I deſire to give you content in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as well as in ſhew, that you ſhall have a Bill for doing thereof, ſo that it do not trench neither againſt my Honor, neither againſt the ancient Prerogatives of the Crownes concerning Parliaments, Ingeniouſly confeſſe, often Parliaments is the ſitteſt means to keep correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency between Me and my People, that I do ſo much deſire.</p>
            <p>To conclude, now all that I have ſhewn you, the ſtate of my Affairs, My own cleer intentions, and the Rooks I would have you ſhun.</p>
            <p>To give you all contentment, you ſhall likewiſe finde by theſe Miniſters, I have, or ſhall have, about me for the effecting of theſe my good intentions; which ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double the peace of the Kingdome, and content you all.

            <p>MY Lords, and you the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes of the Houſe of Commons; you may remember when both Houſes were with Me at the Banquetting Houſe at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> I did declare unto you two Rocks I wiſhed you to eſchew, this is the one of them, and of that conſequence, that I think never Bill paſſed here in this Houſe of more favour to the Subjects then this is, and if the other Rock be as happily paſſed over as this ſhall be at this time, I do not know what you can ask, for ought I can ſee at this time, that I can make any queſtion to yeeld unto: Therefore I mention this to ſhew unto you the ſence that I have of this Bill, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, as I may ſay, that you have to me for it, for hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, to ſpeak freely, I have had no great incouragement to do it; if I ſhould look to the outward face of your actions or proceedings, and not look to the inward intentions of your hearts, I might make queſtion of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>

            <head>His Majeſties Speech to both the Houſes of Parliament. <hi>February</hi> 3. 1640.</head>
            <p>HAving taken into my ſerious conſideration, the late Remonſtrance made unto me by the Houſe of Parliament, I give you this anſwer.</p>
            <p>That I take in good part your care of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eſtabliſhed in this Kingdome, from which I will never depart, as alſo for the tenderneſſe of my ſafety, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of this State and Government: It is againſt my minde, that Popery or Superſtition ſhould any way en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe within this Kingdome, and will reſtrain the ſame by cauſing the Laws to be put in execution.</p>
            <p>I am reſolved to provide againſt the Jeſuits and Papiſts, by ſetting forth a Proclamation with all ſpeed, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to depart the Kingdome within one Moneth, which if they fail, or ſhall return, then they ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt according to the Laws.</p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Roſettie;</hi> I give you to underſtand, that the Queen hath alwayes aſſured me, that to her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he hath no Commiſſion, but onely to entertain a perſonall correſpondence between her and the Pope, in things requiſite for the Exerciſe of her Religion, which is warranted to her by the Articles of Marriage, which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103839:7"/>give her a full Liberty of Conſcience; yet I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded her, that ſince the miſunderſtanding of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons condition gives offence, ſhe will within a convenient time remove him.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I will take a ſpeciall care to reſtrain my Subjects from reſorting to Maſſe at <hi>Denmark</hi> houſe, Saint <hi>James,</hi> and the Chappel of Ambaſſadors.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, concerning <hi>John Goodman</hi> the Prieſt, I will let you know the reaſon why I reprived him, that as I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, neither Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> nor my Father did ever avow, that any Prieſt in their times was executed meerly for Religion, which to me ſeems to be this particular caſe, yet ſeeing that I am preſſed by both Houſes, to give way to his, becauſe I will avoid the inconveniency of giving ſo great diſcontent to my people, as I conceive this Mercy may produce, therefore I do remit this particular Cauſe to both the Houſes: But I deſire them to take into their conſideration, the inconveniencies (as I conceive) may upon this occaſion fall upon my Subjects and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants abroad, eſpecially ſince it may ſeem to other States to be a ſeverity, which ſurpriſe having thus repreſented, I think my ſelf diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from all ill conſequence that may enſue upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of this perſon.</p>

            <p>I Did yeſterday ſatisfie the Juſtice of the Kingdom by paſſing of the Bill of Attainder againſt the Earl of <hi>Strafford;</hi> but mercy being as inherent, and inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a King as Juſtice. I deſire at this time in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſhew, that likewiſe by ſuffering that unfortunate man to fulfill the naturall courſe of his life in a cloſe im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>priſonment; yet ſo, that if ever he make the leaſt offer to eſcape, or offer directly, or indirectly to meddle in any ſort of Publique buſineſſe; eſpecially with me, either by Meſſage, or Letter, it ſhall coſt him his life without further Proceſſe. This, if it may be done without the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment of my People, will be an unſpeakable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to me.</p>
            <p>To which end, as in the firſt place, I by this Letter do earneſtly deſire your approbation, and to endear it the more, have choſen him to carry it, that of all your Houſe is moſt dear to me. So I deſire that by a conference, you will endeavour to give the Houſe of Commons content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Likewiſe aſſuring you, that the excuſe of mercy is no more pleaſing to me, then to ſee both Houſes of Parliament conſent for my ſake, that I ſhould moderate the ſeverity of the Law, in ſo important a caſe.</p>

            <p>I will not ſay that your complying with me, in this my intended mercy, ſhall make me more willing, but certainly t'will make me more cheerfull in granting your juſt grievances. But if no leſſe then his life can ſatisfie my People, I muſt ſay <hi>fiat juſtitia.</hi> Thus again recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the conſideration of my intentions to you, I reſt.</p>

            <p>THis Letter all written with the Kings own hand, the Peers this day received in Parliament, delivered by the hand of the Prince. It was twice read in the Houſe, and after ſerious and ſad conſideration, the Houſe reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved preſently to ſend 12. of the Peers Meſſengers to the King; humbly to ſignifie, that neither of the two inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions expreſſed in the Letter, could with duty in them, or without danger to himſelf, his deareſt Conſort the Queen, and all the young Princes their Children, poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be adviſed: With all which being done accordingly, and the reaſons ſhewed to his Majeſty, He ſuffered no more words to come from them, but out of the fulneſſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103839:8"/>of his heart to the obſervance of Juſtice, and for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of his people, told them, that what he intended by his Letter was with an (if) if it may be done without diſcontentment of his People; if that cannot be, I ſay again the ſame that I writ, <hi>fiat juſtitia.</hi> My other inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proceeding out of charity for a few dayes reſpite, was upon certain information that His Eſtate was ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, that it neceſſarily required ſome few dayes for ſettlement thereof.</p>
            <p>Whereunto the Lords anſwered, their purpoſe was to be Suitors to his Majeſty for favour to be ſhewed to his innocent Children; and if himſelf had made any provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for them, that the ſame might hold.</p>
            <p>This was well liking to his Majeſty, who thereupon departed from the Lords; at His Majeſties parting they offered up into his hands the Letter it ſelf which he had ſent; but He was pleaſed to ſay, my Lords, what I have written to you, I ſhall content i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
